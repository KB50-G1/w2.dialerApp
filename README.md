w2. Dialer App Assignment
================

In this assignment you will have to make an app together with the project group. In this app you can enter a phone number and the app will show the country to which the phone number belongs. (31704458190 is for example the Netherlands) The app has to have the following structure:

1. The screen which is shown after start up gives you the opportunity to enter a phone number. The screen consists of 10 buttons and each of those buttons has a number. Alongside these buttons there is also a field which shows the entered numbers and a “show country” button. The resulting screen could be compared with a calculator application.

2. When the show country button is pressed a new screen (!) (so no pop up or toast) is shown and this screen shows the country that belongs to the entered phone number. In this screen there are also two buttons present. One button allows you to go back to the previous input screen and the other allows you to call the entered phone number.

There are a number of things that will lead to extra complexity within your application and also to a higher grade. Some examples:

1. When returning back to the input screen from the screen with the shown country the phone number is still shown.

2. Recognition of a valid phone number. (This is not achievable for all countries, but it is at least for the Netherlands)

3. When the app is started a welcome screen is shown. This screen will disappear after four seconds.

As always pay attention to the structure and clarity of your code. (coupling, cohesion and responsibility driven design), because this is also taken into account for your grade. In order to achieve this make a UML class diagram first. An analysis class diagram is sufficient, but a design class diagram is of course also permitted. Hand in this class diagram together with your code.
